# IBM Quantum Awards: Open Science Prize 2022

## Files

1. `1-kagome-vqe-HEA-Two-Local.ipynb` is the first notebook which describes the problem statement and uses a HEA Two local ansatz to solve for the ground state energy of the given unit cell of Kagome lattice.
2. `2-kagome-vqe-HEA-Pairwise.ipynb` builds upon the previous notebook but uses a reduced depth ansatz.
3. `3-kagome-vqe-HVA.ipynb` shows the use of Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA).
4. `saved_results` holds the results obtained during noisy simulations with the three notebooks.

## Misc files

1. `heisenberg_model.py` contains the class for creation of Heisenberg XXX model.
2. `images` stores images rendered in jupyter notebooks.
